##Description:
This Cryptocurrency Monitor is a peice of software which utilizes various RESTAPI calls to display and calculate market data from various Bitcoin Websites (Coinbase, Cryptsy, BTC-E, Blockchain.info) 

The reason this project started was out of laziness, I grew tired of looking at multiple websites as well as using calculators and copying and pasting values from web-pages.

The market Data page helped me quickly look at what my "portfolio" is at, as well as quickly viewing Buy/Sell data on Cryptsy and other Bitcoin Prices/Market data from Coinbase and btc-e and Blockchain.info. 

The Mining tools page can also create mining statements and helps manage launching the mining commands when yuou would have possibly had a bunch of batch files in the past. 

The Address storage page acts as a place to paste strings, so you dont have to open your wallets or go to other sites to get at your various currency addresses.

This project was done using only C# Visual Studio .NET Libraries coupled with a few other open source libraries, I created a Cryptocurrency Monitor. It mainly has been used to calculate profits/losses for myself. It enabled me to view several websites data all at once and to monitor the worth of my portfolio.
